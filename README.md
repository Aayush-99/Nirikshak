# __NIRIKSHAK__

Social Distancing – the term that has taken the world by storm and is transforming the way we live. Social distancing has become a mantra around the world, transcending languages and cultures.
The biggest cause of concern is that COVID-19 spreads from person to person through contact or if you’re within close proximity of an infected person. Given how densely populated some areas are, this has been quite a challenge.

Nirikshak is a tool that detects people in real time and returns a bounding box that turns red if the distance between two people is dangerously close.
This would help the authorities monitoring the potentially crowded areas to easily detect if social distancing protocols are being followed or not and necessary mesaures be taken to implement it.
